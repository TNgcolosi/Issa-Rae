        <p>Issa Rae is the queen of #blackgirlsrock, #melaninmagic and #representation matters that we all didn't know we needed.</p> 
          <p>She is a Senegalise/American writer, producer, director, actress who has become most famous for bringing us the awesome series, Insecure. Insecure is a really important show, in a time where there are so few shows with complex black characters, it has an almost all black cast that 
        is mainly dark skinned, natural haired, and authentically representative of the culture of 2018. It's a representation of black people who are not suffering, are living this life as best they can, and it just allows us to enjoy a different and beautiful tv experience. and the BEST thing about it? It slaaays! Don't beleive me?</p> <p>Check the list:</p>
        <p><ul>
          <li>Golden Globes Nominee 2017 & 2018</li>    
          <li>Primetime Emmy Awards Nominee 2018</li>
          <li>BET Awards Nominee 2017 & 2018</li>
          <li>Black Reel Awards for Television Winner 2018</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>You definitely need to find out <a target="_blank" href="http://time.com/collection/most-influential-people-2018/5217607/issa-rae/"> more on Issa and her magic.</a> Also, I'm a huge fan of A Wrinkle in Time too so this word by Mindy Kaling is everything! </p><p class="iStan"> I love that Issa has produced something that I would definitely want 
    to keep in the media archives for my children to see - as "vintage" media when they are adults. For this, Issa is a hero to me and my dark-skinned daughter who often struggles to see herself as beautiful in comparison to all the light skinned imagery she sees in media.   </p>
